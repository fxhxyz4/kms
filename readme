               WINDOWS / OFFICE KMS TOOL
====================================================

This script is designed to activate Windows and 
    Microsoft Office using a KMS server

The script supports two modes:
1. Local KMS server via Docker (vlmcsd)
2. Activation via online KMS servers (at your own risk)

Supported:
- Windows 10 (Pro, Enterprise, Education, etc.)
- Windows 11 (corresponding editions)
- Microsoft Office 2010/2013/2016/2019/2021

====================================================

About the `count` variable in vlmcsd:

By default, vlmcsd (KMS emulator) starts responding to activation

requests only after receiving at least 25** requests from one

version of Windows or Office (this is the behavior of real KMS).

To change this and **enable activation immediately**, you can specify the
parameter `-c` or `--count` when starting the container:

Example (this can be changed in the script code):

docker run -it --rm --name vlmcsd_kms mikolatero/vlmcsd /bin/sh
./vlmcsd -c 1
The value `-c 1` means that activation will work even with 1 client.

⚠️ **It is recommended** to use `count = 1` for local use
or tests, so as not to wait for 25 clients to "accumulate".
